# nexsci-dash-notebooks

A Collection of Jupyter Notebooks for Working with NExScI (and Some Other) Datasets.

Several NASA Exoplanet Science Institute (NExScI) projects provide web services for direct data download.  By combining these with data visualization and dashboarding tools from Plotly / Dash, we can create a set of Jupyter Notebooks for visualization and manipulation of our holdings.  

For most of the Notebooks, the associated dashboard is implemented as a separate pop-up window rather than in-line on the Notebook page.  In these cases, a separate PNG screen-dump is provided that illustrated the functionality.
